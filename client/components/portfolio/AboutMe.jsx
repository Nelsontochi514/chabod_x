        <p className="mb-4">
          Even though I can't fully recall how it all started, I still do remember that I had a
          great passion and obscession for programming and start-ups. <br /> Today, I am a fullstack
          Javascript developer(ReactJs/NextJs + NodeJs), a blockchain(solidity) developer, and a
          technical writer.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I am a highly gifted and intelligent Nigerian, who is passionate about building
          ground-breaking inventions with code. I command very high fluency in English which is one
          among the three languages that I speak. <br /> I am passionate about learning new
          technologies, as well as my continuous growth as a programmer.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">I love God a lot, and people do mean a lot to me as well.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I have about 2 years of experience in web development(including my formative/learning
          period) - most of which I spent doing front-end web development. Most of my growth as a
          programmer, have been through personal(self learning) efforts. <br /> I have a strong eye
          for design, and I am very passionate about building pixel-perfect user-interfaces as a
          front-end web developer.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I've had the opportunity to work on some development teams. Having served as team lead
          before, I have been able to develop some necessary soft-skills to help me cope and adapt
          to team work - whether as team-lead or not. <br />

          Talking experience, 2022 had a lot to speak for me. In 2022, I participated in the Polygon
          Africa web3/blockchain bootcamp, and my project(Deeco) - was fourth on the list of winners
          in my category of the bootcamp hackathon. <br /> Deeco is a blockchain e-commerce
          platform. It powers e-commerce experiences but with cryptocurrency based payments. Despite
          being the only member of my solo team, I was able to deliver both as the front-end
          developer, and also the smart-contract(blockchain) developer - within only a number of
          days. You can{' '}

          Right now, I am open to any roles, but I am most interested in taking up a role on which I
          will work as a fullstack-blockchain developer - buiding sleek user-interfaces, building
          APIs and other back-end functionalities, while also building the smart-contract(s) to
          power decentralized applications of any scale.
