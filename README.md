# Chabod_x

Chabod_x is a fullstack blog-folio web-app. It is a new and more powerful/advanced version of the [Chabod project](https://github.com/Okpainmo/get_chabod). It's a sleeker and super amazing NextJs/ReactJs version ot the project. I am building it as a brand new blog-folio (portfolio website + blog) for every interested person - beginning with myself ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©.

The back-end is built with NodeJs using ExpressJs. Database is MongoDB, and ODM is Mongoose.

> ðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢ Best news is this - **It's OPENSOURCE** ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰.

> Simply
>
> - Fork or clone it.
> - Tweak it - if you wish.
> - Host the Back-end.
> - Walk around and get to know how to use all of it's awesomeness.
> - Own it - it's yours.

> Please, Don't forget to contribute to the project - Even a gesture as simple as a **star** will mean a lot.
> You can also share your tweaks and share how much unique awesomenes you added to yours.
