# Chabod_x - still in progress

Chabod_x is a fullstack blog-folio web-app. It is a new and more powerful/advanced version of the [Chabod project](https://github.com/Okpainmo/get_chabod). It's a sleeker and super amazing NextJs/ReactJs version ot the project. I am building it as a brand new blog-folio (portfolio website + blog) for every interested person - beginning with myself ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©.

The project back-end is built with NodeJs using ExpressJs. Database is MongoDB, and ODM is Mongoose.

> ðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢ Best news is this - **It's OPENSOURCE** ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰.

This project will help you own a portfolio website which also contains a super-amazing custom blog - **"FOR FREEEEEE!!!"**

> Please note however, that you'll need to add this simple attribution to the base/footer of your own blog-folio website
> "Thanks to chabod-x(link back to the chabod-x repo), and ajokpainmo(link to my website - https://ajokpainmo.com)"
